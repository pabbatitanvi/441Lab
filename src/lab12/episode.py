Lab 12: Beginnings of Reinforcement Learning

Create a function called run_episode that takes in two players
and runs a single episode of combat between them. 
As per RL conventions, the function should return a list of tuples
of the form (observation/state, action, reward) for each turn in the episode.
Note that observation/state is a tuple of the form (player1_health, player2_health).
Action is simply the weapon selected by the player.
Reward is the reward for the player for that turn.
